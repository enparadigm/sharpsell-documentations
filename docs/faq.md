<summary>I want to integrate Sharpsell SDK, what if my appâ€™s target android version is different from that of Sharpsell?</summary>

There is something called `<uses-sdk/>` contained in `<manifest>` which lets you express an application's compatibility with one or more versions of the Android platform, by means of an API Level integer. The API Level expressed by an application will be compared to the API Level of a given Android system, which may vary among different Android devices.
