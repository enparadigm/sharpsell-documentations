## Using SCORM in Sharpsell

:::::info[**How does SCORM work in Sharpsell?** ]

- Learning admin is where the **SCORM** learning units can be created.

- These learning units can be mapped to learning journeys and the users can consume this content on the app.

- The admin user can create a **SCORM** unit, upload the **SCORM** file and proceed with adding this unit with the learning journeys.

:::tip[Pre requisites]

1. **SCORM** compliant content should be available `(.zip files)`

:::::

:::note

- Please ensure you that you are uploading **SCORM** compliant file only.

- Please ensure quiz completion and scores are enabled in the **SCORM** file.

- Please ensure the pass % in **SCORM** file and the subtopic pass % is same. For all calculation purposes, if the **SCORM** file returns a score, the same would be used in Sharpsell. If score is not configured in **SCORM** file, Sharpsell sets the score to 0 or 100 based on completion status.

- Please ensure that pass or fail threshold is set up in the right way in the **SCORM** file.

- Please ensure the score is configured in the **SCORM** file, if it is an important tracking metric.

- Once the file is uploaded, please allow some time for it to be processed. This time may vary depending on the file size, internet bandwidth, stability of the connection.

- Please check the preview of an uploaded file to verify the content and the playability of the **SCORM** file

- Please note that a subtopic can have only **SCORM** units in it or it can have any of Content, Quiz or feedback units. Both **SCORM** and other unit types will not be available in a single sub topic.

- Preparing the **SCORM** progress for a user takes time. This will depend on factors like course size, internet bandwidth and stability of the connection. If the score/progress is not available when the **SCORM** unit is completed, please wait for some time and resync the app. This will allow us to recheck and update the progress correctly.
