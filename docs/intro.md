#### Hanuman Kamma (CO-FOUNDER & CEO) and Arun Subramanian (CO-FOUNDER AND CBO)

- Our **co-founders Arun and Hanuman** have been working with **sales leaders, training teams, and sales transformation teams** for a decade to create effective sales learning and onboarding solutions.

- They have shadowed 100s of sales people across industries, spending over 1000 hours to understand the day-to-day challenges. They have observed first-hand the challenges faced by sales people to get meetings, have effective customer conversations, and drive numbers.

:::note[**overview**]
We have spent hours with sales people and experienced first hand their struggles.

We have seen them desperately follow-up with prospects who are not willing to meet, try to effectively pitch a product in minutes when all they have is a 20 slide brochure, reach out to a colleague or a manager on how to handle an objection, or hastily put together a customer specific presentation while jumping from one meeting to another.
